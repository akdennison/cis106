# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text in a simple and readable way. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of making text easy to write and easy to convert into structured formats like HTML and PDF. Instead of using complex code, markdown uses simple symbols to create headings, paragraphs, bold and italic text, links, tables, and code blocks. Markdown files are easy to read even without formatting and can be opened on virtually any device or operating system. It simplifies things.
